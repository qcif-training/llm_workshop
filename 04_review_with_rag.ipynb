The capacity is an important indicator for a battery. Methods to improve the capacity of quantum batteries are important. We consider quantum batteries given by bipartite quantum systems and study the enhancement of the battery capacity under local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state. By using two-qubit Bell-diagonal states and X-type states as examples, we show that quantum battery capacity with respect to the whole system or a subsystem can be improved by local projective measurements.

We investigate the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians, with a particular focus on minimizing the battery s influence during the charging dynamics. To achieve this, we introduce a control parameter that allows us to suppress the battery s contribution during the charging dynamics. We explore various configurations, including a non-interacting many-body battery with an interacting many-body charger, an interacting battery with a non-interacting charger, and systems where both the battery and charger are interacting many-body systems.

This protocol shows super-extensive charging through collective coupling of the charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir. When applied to multiple quantum batteries, each coupled to different thermal reservoirs, the energy cannot be efficiently transferred from the charger to the battery via collective dissipation alone.

      "The influence of local projective measurements on the charging capacity of quantum batteries has been a subject of interest in recent studies. Research has shown that local projective measurements can enhance the capacity of quantum batteries, particularly in bipartite quantum systems (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1). By applying local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state, the battery capacity with respect to the whole system or a subsystem can be improved. This has been demonstrated using two-qubit Bell-diagonal states and X-type states as examples, highlighting the potential of local projective measurements in optimizing quantum battery performance (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1). Furthermore, the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians has also been investigated, with a focus on minimizing the battery's influence during the charging dynamics (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08029v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimization of quantum battery performance is a complex task, involving the manipulation of various parameters to achieve efficient charging. In addition to local projective measurements, other strategies have been proposed to enhance charging capacity. For instance, a protocol that utilizes dissipation and pumping to charge multiple open quantum batteries in parallel has been explored (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1). This approach enables super-extensive charging through collective coupling of the charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir. Moreover, the incorporation of both dissipation and incoherent collective pumping on the charger has been shown to facilitate efficient parallel charging of many quantum batteries (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1). These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, including local projective measurements and charging dynamics, to optimize the performance of quantum batteries (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08029v1).\n"

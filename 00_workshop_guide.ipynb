    "\n",
    "This workshop provides a practical, researcher-focused introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs), with a primary focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured content summarisation**  \n",
    "- **Code generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sectors this applies to**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the workshop is designed for academic users, the same techniques and code snippets can be easily repurposed across sectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Academia:** creating structured literature reviews and research summaries  \n",
    "- **Industry:** summarising technical or standards documents for engineering teams  \n",
    "- **Government:** preparing policy summaries, briefs, and evidence-based guidance for decision-makers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this workshop covers\n",
    "- How to use LLMs for **summarisation**, **code generation**, **literature analysis**, and **knowledge synthesis**  \n",
    "- Foundations of **prompt structure**, **retrieval grounding**, **avoiding hallucinations**, and **safe data handling**\n",
    "- How to build **transparent, auditable workflows** suitable for academic, clinical, and technical domains  \n",
    "- Understanding when LLMs help—and when they shouldn’t be used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who this is for\n",
    "- Researchers interested in literature reviews or code generation   \n",
    "- Anyone wanting structured, defensible LLM workflows\n",

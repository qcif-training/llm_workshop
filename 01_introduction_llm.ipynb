        "\n",
        "This notebook is the first module of a workshop on using Large Language Models (LLMs) in research workflows. It focuses on:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Setting up access to an LLM via the **Groq** API using the **OpenAI-compatible** Python client.\n",
        "- Running your **first query** and understanding the request/response structure.\n",
        "- Exploring the notion of **temperature** (randomness) in generation.\n",
        "- Creating a **continuous conversation** by keeping your own chat history.\n",
        "\n",
        "We adopt a **text-only** approach (no image/graph understanding) to ensure minimal setup and maximum reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
        "1. Configure a connection to the Groq API.\n",
        "2. Send chat messages with the OpenAI-compatible client.\n",
        "3. Control generation behaviour via `temperature`.\n",
        "4. Maintain and reuse chat history for a continuing conversation.\n",

        "## Background (very briefly)\n",
        "An LLM is a probabilistic model over text. Given a sequence of tokens $x_{1:t}$, it assigns probabilities to the next token $x_{t+1}$. At inference, models sample from a distribution such as\n",
        "$$p(x_{t+1}=i\\mid x_{1:t}) = \\mathrm{softmax}\\!\\left(\\frac{z_i}{T}\\right),$$\n",
        "where $z_i$ is the logit for token $i$ and $T>0$ is the **temperature**. Lower $T$ concentrates probability mass on high-logit tokens (more deterministic), while higher $T$ spreads it out (more diverse). We will **demonstrate** this behaviour below.\n"

            "As a bioinformatician, you're likely familiar with complex systems and data-driven approaches. Renewable energy policy research presents several challenges that can be broken down into the following categories:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Integration and Interoperability**: Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have variable output, making it challenging to integrate them into existing energy grids. This requires advanced forecasting and grid management systems to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply.\n",
            "2. **Data Quality and Availability**: High-quality data on energy production, consumption, and grid operations is essential for informed policy decisions. However, data gaps, inconsistencies, and lack of standardization can hinder research and policy development.\n",
            "3. **Complexity and Uncertainty**: Renewable energy systems involve complex interactions between technological, economic, social, and environmental factors. Uncertainties, such as future energy demand, technology costs, and policy frameworks, can make it difficult to predict the effectiveness of different policy interventions.\n",
            "4. **Spatial and Temporal Scales**: Renewable energy policy research must consider multiple spatial scales (e.g., local, regional, national) and temporal scales (e.g., short-term, long-term). This requires balancing competing priorities, such as energy security, economic development, and environmental protection.\n",
            "5. **Stakeholder Engagement and Social Acceptance**: Effective policy development requires engagement with diverse stakeholders, including industry, government, civil society, and local communities. Social acceptance of renewable energy technologies and infrastructure can be a significant challenge, particularly if it involves land use changes or community disruption.\n",
            "6. **Economic and Financial Challenges**: Renewable energy technologies can be capital-intensive, and their economic viability often depends on policy support, such as tax incentives, subsidies, or carbon pricing. Fluctuations in energy markets, technology costs, and policy frameworks can create uncertainty and affect investment decisions.\n",
            "7. **Policy Frameworks and Governance**: Renewable energy policy research must navigate complex governance structures, including international agreements, national policies, and regional regulations. Effective policy frameworks require coordination, consistency, and adaptability to address the dynamic nature of the energy sector.\n",
            "8. **Technology and Innovation**: The rapid evolution of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, creates opportunities for improved efficiency and reduced costs. However, it also poses challenges for policy development, as technologies may become outdated or new ones may emerge, requiring updates to policy frameworks.\n",
            "9. **Environmental and Social Impacts**: Renewable energy technologies can have environmental and social implications, such as land use changes, water usage, or community displacement. Policy research must consider these impacts and develop strategies to mitigate them.\n",
            "10. **Scalability and Replicability**: Renewable energy policy research must be scalable and replicable across different contexts, including developed and developing countries, to ensure widespread adoption and maximize global benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "By acknowledging these challenges, researchers and policymakers can develop more effective strategies to address the complexities of renewable energy policy research and create a more sustainable energy future. As a bioinformatician, you can apply your expertise in data analysis, modeling, and computational methods to help tackle these challenges and contribute to the development of evidence-based renewable energy policies.\n"

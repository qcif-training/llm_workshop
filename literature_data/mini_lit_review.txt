The influence of local projective measurements on the charging capacity of quantum batteries has been a subject of interest in recent studies. Research has shown that local projective measurements can enhance the capacity of quantum batteries, particularly when considering bipartite quantum systems (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1). By applying local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state, the battery capacity with respect to the whole system or a subsystem can be improved. This has been demonstrated using two-qubit Bell-diagonal states and X-type states as examples, highlighting the potential for local projective measurements to optimize quantum battery performance (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1).

The optimization of quantum battery performance is a complex task that involves understanding the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians. To minimize the battery's influence during charging dynamics, a control parameter can be introduced to suppress the battery's contribution (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08029v1). Furthermore, efficient charging of multiple open quantum batteries can be achieved through dissipation and pumping, where collective coupling of the charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir enables super-extensive charging (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1). The incorporation of both dissipation and incoherent collective pumping on the charger can also facilitate efficient parallel charging of many quantum batteries, even when each battery is coupled to a different thermal reservoir (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1). These findings highlight the importance of considering local projective measurements and charging dynamics in the optimization of quantum battery capacity.

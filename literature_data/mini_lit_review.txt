The influence of local projective measurements on the charging capacity of quantum batteries has been a subject of interest in recent studies. Research has shown that local projective measurements can enhance the capacity of quantum batteries, particularly in bipartite quantum systems (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1). By applying local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state, the battery capacity with respect to the whole system or a subsystem can be improved. This has been demonstrated using two-qubit Bell-diagonal states and X-type states as examples, highlighting the potential of local projective measurements in optimizing quantum battery performance (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1). Furthermore, the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians has also been investigated, with a focus on minimizing the battery's influence during the charging dynamics (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08029v1).

The optimization of quantum battery performance is a complex task, involving the manipulation of various parameters to achieve efficient charging. In addition to local projective measurements, other strategies have been proposed to enhance charging capacity. For instance, a protocol that utilizes dissipation and pumping to charge multiple open quantum batteries in parallel has been explored (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1). This approach enables super-extensive charging through collective coupling of the charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir. Moreover, the incorporation of both dissipation and incoherent collective pumping on the charger has been shown to facilitate efficient parallel charging of many quantum batteries (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1). These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, including local projective measurements and charging dynamics, to optimize the performance of quantum batteries (http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08029v1).

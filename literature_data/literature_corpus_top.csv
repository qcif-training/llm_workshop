Quantum battery is of signiﬁcant potential applications in future industry and daily life. The
battery capacity is an important indicator of a battery. How to improve the capacity of quantum
batteries is of importance. We consider quantum batteries g iven by bipartite quantum systems, and
study the enhancement of the battery capacity under local pr ojective measurements on a subsystem
of the quantum state. By using the two-qubit Bell diagonal st ates and the X-type states as examples,
we show that the quantum battery capacity with respect to the whole system or the subsystem could
be improved by local projective measurements. Our theoreti cal analysis will provide new ideas for
the experimental development of quantum battery.

INTRODUCTION
As an energy storage system, the battery plays sig-
niﬁcant roles in both industry and daily life. With
the development of quantum technology and informa-
tion science, the quantum battery has emerged and
been expected to balance the advantages of small size,
large capacity, portability, rapid charging etc. R. Al-
icki and M. Fannes ﬁrst formally introduced the idea
of quantum batteries in an informational theoretic con-
text by characterizing the maximum amount of energy
that can be extracted from a quantum system under
unitary operations [1]. Since then there have been ex-
tensive theoretical [2–53] and experimental[54–58] stud-
ies on quantum batteries. For example, many theo-
retical protocols have been proposed, such as charg-
ing by entangling operations[6, 7, 9, 14, 29, 36], charg-
ing with dissipative[29, 30], charging collectively and in
parallel[10, 30]. Many-body interaction and energy ﬂuc-
tuation were also explored[11, 13, 25–27, 37, 38, 48]. The
ﬁrst model of a quantum battery that could be engineered
in a solid-state architecture, was proposed by Ferraro et
al.[10]. Many other concrete quantum battery models
have been also proposed[11, 19, 52]. However, many as-
pects of the physics of quantum batteries remain unex-
plored, experimental work on quantum batteries is still in
its infancy and a fully-operational proof of principle is yet
to be demonstrated. For a review of quantum batteries,
we refer to Ref.[50].
An important quantitative indicator of the quality of
quantum batteries is the capacity (charging power, work
storage, work extraction) [31, 42]. The commonly used
quantity is the ergotropy functional [31],
E(ρ,H) = max
U∈U(d)
{Tr[ρH] − Tr[UρU†H]},
where ρ is the quantum state of a d-dimensional quan-
tum system Qwith Hamiltonian H, the maximum takes
over the states under all unitary evolution ρ → UρU†,
with U(d) the set of the unitary operators acting on Q.
More recently, in Ref. [42] the authors provided a new
deﬁnition of quantum battery capacity,
C(ρ,H) :=
d−1∑
i=0
ǫi(λi − λd−1−i), (1)
where λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λd−1 denote the eigenvalues of
the quantum state ρ and ǫ0 ≤ ǫ1 ≤ · · · ≤ ǫd−1 denote
the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian H = ∑
i ǫi|εi⟩⟨εi|.
C(ρ,H) is a Schur-convex functional of the quantum
state and does not change when the battery is unitar-
ily charged or discharged.
Quantum measurements, particularly the projections
onto a chosen state, could change the transition rate of
the measured system [59]. Numerous measurement-based
control schemes have been applied to state puriﬁcation
[60, 61], information gain [62] and entropy production
[63]. The measurement on auxiliary systems may help to
control the target systems, serving as state-engineering
scheme through a nonunitary procedure [64, 65]. In deed,
the idea of improving the desired eﬀect of the target sys-
tem by measuring the auxiliary system has recently been
applied to quantum battery charging [41] and power ex-
traction [49]. In [41], the authors established for quantum
battery a charging by-measurement framework based on
rounds of joint evolution and partial-projection. Start-
ing from a thermal state, the battery could also achieve a
2
near-unit ratio of ergotropy and energy through less than
N measurements, when a population inversion is realized
by measurements. In [49] the authors focused on the en-
ergy extraction instead of charging, that is, the protocol
includes only one measurement on the auxiliary qubit,
but not a sequence of measurements. Scenarios are in-
vestigated for both that the initial state of the battery
and the auxiliary is a product and an entangled one. It is
shown that the measurement-based protocol provides sig-
niﬁcantly better energy extraction from a quantum bat-
tery than that based on unitary operations.
Consider a bipartite system composed of the target
quantum state Aand the auxiliary system B. Our ques-
tion is how the quantum measurements on the systems B
would aﬀect the quantum battery capacity of the system
A or the whole bipartite system. In this paper, we for-
mulate a unilateral measurement protocol and study such
local projective measurement-enhanced quantum battery
capacity by starting directly from general bipartite quan-
tum states. In general, a complete quantum battery con-
sists of a battery part and a charger part. Here, we only
consider the battery part, that is, the whole system bat-
tery is composed by two-particle quantum state ρAB and
the system Hamiltonian HAB . And the battery of the
subsystem is composed by the reduced state ρA and the
Hamiltonian HA corresponding to the subsystem A. We
use the deﬁnition of quantum battery capacity given by
Eq.(1). We ﬁnd that for two-qubit Werner states, the
local measurements can enhance the overall or the sub-
system battery capacity.
MEASUREMENT-BASED PROTOCOL
Let ρAB be an m⊗ n bipartite state in Hilbert space
HA ⊗ H B . Let HA = ∑ m−1
i=0 ǫA
i |εi⟩A⟨εi| and HB =∑ n−1
i=0 ǫB
i |εi⟩B⟨εi| be the Hamiltonian associated with the
systems A and B, respectively. The Hamiltonian of the
joint system is HAB = HA ⊗In +Im ⊗HB, where In (Im)
denotes the n× n(m× m) identity matrix. The battery
capacity C(ρAB,HAB) can be calculated by using Eq.(1).
Let ρA = ∑ m−1
i=0 λi|ψi⟩⟨ψi| be the reduced state of the
subsystem A. We have the battery capacity with respect
to the subsystem A, C(ρA,HA) = ∑ m−1
i=0 ǫA
i (λi −λd−1−i).
Let {Bk}n−1
k=0 be a rank-1 local projective measurement
on the subsystem B. Conditioned on the measurement
outcome k, the quantum state ρAB changes to be
ρk
AB = 1
Pk
(Im ⊗ Bk)ρAB (Im ⊗ Bk) (2)
with probability Pk = Tr(Im ⊗ Bk)ρAB(Im ⊗ Bk) for
k = 0 ,1,2,· · · ,n − 1. The ﬁnal state ρ′
AB depends on
the measurement basis as well as the outcomes. Under

With arbitrary randomness probability, namely, the mea-

i=0 ǫA
i (λ′

d−1−i), see Fig. 1. for
the schematic diagram. In the following we focus on two
particular classes of initial states.
Two-qubit Bell-diagonal states
We ﬁrst consider the initial states to be the two-qubit
Bell-diagonal ones:
ρAB = 1
4 (I2 ⊗ I2 +
3∑
i=1
ciσi ⊗ σi),
where σ1,σ2,σ3 are the standard Pauli matrices, ci are
real constants such that ρAB is a well deﬁned density
matrix. ρAB have eigenvalues λ0 = (1 − c1 − c2 − c3)/4,
λ1 = (1 − c1 + c2 + c3)/4, λ2 = (1 + c1 − c2 + c3)/4 and
λ3 = (1+ c1 +c2 −c3)/4. The coeﬃcients ci are so chosen
that λj ∈ [0,1] for j = 0 ,1,2,3. For the convenience
of future analysis, we assume that |c1| ≥ | c2| ≥ | c3|.
3
We consider the following Hamiltonian for the two-qubit
system,
HAB = ǫAσ3 ⊗ I2 + ǫBI2 ⊗ σ3, (5)
where ǫA ≥ ǫB ≥ 0. The eigenvalues of HAB are −ǫA −
ǫB, −ǫA + ǫB, ǫA − ǫB and ǫA + ǫB in ascending order.
Therefore, we have
C(ρAB ,HAB) = ( |c1|+|c2|)(ǫA+ǫB)+(|c1|−|c2|)(ǫA−ǫB).
The reduced states of ρAB are ρA = I2/2 and ρB = I2/2.
Consequently, we have C(ρA,HA) = 0.
Consider local projective measurement given by the
computational base {|k⟩}, {Π k = |k⟩⟨k|, k = 0 ,1}. The
measurement gives rise to the ensemble {ρk
AB,Pk}. We
have
Pkρk
AB = ( I2 ⊗ Π k)ρAB(I2 ⊗ Π k)
= 1
4[I2 ⊗ Π k +
3∑
i=1
ciσi ⊗ (Π kσiΠ k)]
= 1
4[I2 ⊗ Π k + (−1)kc3σ3 ⊗ Π k], (6)
where we have used the relations Π kσj Π k = 0 for k =
0,1, j= 1 ,2, Π 0σ3Π 0 = Π 0 and Π 1σ3Π 1 = −Π 1. From
Eq.(6) we get
ρ0
AB = 1



as P0 = P1 = 1
2 .
By straightforward calculation we have the following
observations.
(i) Taking the ﬁnal state to be the one given by (3), we
have ρ′
AB = 1
2
∑ 1
k=0 ρk
AB. Then C(ρ′
AB ,HAB) = 2 |c3|ǫA
and C(ρ′
A,HA) = 0. Therefore, F := C(ρ′
AB,HAB) −
C(ρAB ,HAB) ≤ 0, namely, the local measurement weak-
ens the battery capacity of the whole bipartite system,
but does not change the battery capacity of the subsys-
tem A.
(ii) Taking the ﬁnal state to be the one given by (4), we
have ρ′
AB = µ0ρ0
AB + µ1ρ1
AB. Without loss of generality,
let µ0 > µ1. We obtain C(ρ′
AB,HAB) = ( µ0 − µ1 +
|c3|)(ǫA +ǫB)+( µ1 −µ0 +|c3|)(ǫA −ǫB) and C(ρ′
A,HA) =
2(µ0 − µ1)ǫA|c3|. In this case, the local measurement
could either reduce or increase the battery capacity of the
whole system, but always increase the battery capacity
of the subsystem A.
(iii) When c3 = 0, f := C(ρ′
A,HA) − C(ρA,HA) is
always zero. However, for the ρ′
AB given in (ii), one has
C(ρ′
AB,HAB) = 2( µ0 − µ1)ǫB.
The above observations show that the unilateral mea-
surement on subsystem B may increase the battery ca-
pacity of the subsystem A, but not always the entire sys-
tem.
Example 1: Let us consider a speciﬁc Bell-diagonal
state with c1 = c2 = c3 = −a, i.e., the two-qubit Werner
state [66],
ρW = a|ψ−⟩⟨ψ−| + 1 − a
4 I4,
where |ψ−⟩ = ( |01⟩ − | 10⟩)/
√
2 is the maximally entan-
gled state and 0 ≤ a ≤ 1. ρW is separable when a ≤ 1
3
and entangled otherwise. From the observation (ii), we
see that after the projective measurement on subsystem
B, the battery capacity of the subsystem A increases as
long as a̸= 0 and ǫA >0, no matter if the original state is
separable or entangled. When µ0 − µ1 >a, the measure-
ment on the subsystem B can also increase the battery
capacity of the whole system. When µ0 − µ1 = a, the
battery capacity of the whole system keeps unchanged.
Therefore, for a random probability combination Eq.(4),
by choosing appropriate parameters the local projective
measurement may enhance the battery capacity of the
overall or the individual subsystem.
Two-qubit X-states
We consider the initial states to be the two-qubit X-
type ones,
ρX =




ρ11 0 0 ρ14
0 ρ22 ρ23 0
0 ρ32 ρ33 0
ρ41 0 0 ρ44



 , (7)
where ∑ 4
i=1 ρii = 1, ρ22ρ33 ≥ | ρ23|2 and ρ11ρ44 ≥ | ρ14|2.
ρX is entangled if and only if either ρ11ρ44 ≤ | ρ23|2 or
ρ22ρ33 ≤ | ρ14|2 [67]. The eigenvalues of the two-qubit
X-states are given by
λ0 = 1
2 [(ρ11 + ρ44) +
√
(ρ11 − ρ44)2 + 4|ρ14|2],
λ1 = 1
2 [(ρ11 + ρ44) −
√
(ρ11 − ρ44)2 + 4|ρ14|2],
λ2 = 1
2 [(ρ22 + ρ33) +
√
(ρ22 − ρ33)2 + 4|ρ23|2],
λ3 = 1
2 [(ρ22 + ρ33) −
√
(ρ22 − ρ33)2 + 4|ρ23|2].
The reduced density matrix of the subsystem A,
ρA
X =
(
ρ11 + ρ22 0
0 ρ33 + ρ44
)
, (8)
has eigenvalues λA
0 = ρ11 + ρ22 and λA
1 = ρ33 + ρ44. With
respect to the Hamiltonian (5), one has C(ρX ,HAB) and
C(ρA
X ,HA).
ρX can be rewritten as in Bloch representation,
ρX = 1
4(I2 ⊗ I2 + a3σ3 ⊗ I2 + b3I2 ⊗ σ3 +
3∑
i=1
ciσi ⊗ σi),
4
where a3 = ρ11 + ρ22 − (ρ33 + ρ44), b3 = ρ11 + ρ33 −
(ρ22 + ρ44), c1 = 2( ρ33 + ρ44), c2 = 2( ρ23 − ρ14) and
c3 = ρ11 + ρ44 − (ρ22 + ρ33). After the measurement
Π k = |k⟩⟨k| on subsystem B, we obtain
Pkρk
X = ( I2 ⊗ Π k)ρX (I2 ⊗ Π k)
= 1
4 [I2 ⊗ Π k + a3σ3 ⊗ Π k + b3I2 ⊗ (Π kσ3Π k)

= 1
4 [I2 ⊗ Π k + a3(σ3 ⊗ Π k)
+(−1)kb3(I2 ⊗ Π k) + ( −1)kc3(σ3 ⊗ Π k)]. (9)
Taking k = 0 ,1 into Π k, we obtain speciﬁc probabilities
and corresponding quantum states. Namely, P0 = 1+b3
2 ,
P1 = 1−b3
2 and
ρ0
X = 1
2(1 + b3)




1 + b3 + a3 + c3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 1 + b3 − a3 − c3 0
0 0 0 0



 ,
ρ1
X = 1
2(1 − b3)



0 0 0 0
0 1 − b3 + a3 − c3 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 − b3 − a3 + c3



 .
From Eq.(3) or Eq.(4) we can investigate the projective
measurement impact on the battery capacity of subsys-
tem A and the whole bipartite system.
Example 2: Consider the following speciﬁc state,
ρAB = 1
3 [(1 − x)|00⟩⟨00| + 2|ψ+⟩⟨ψ+| + x|11⟩⟨11|],
where x∈ [0,1/2] and |ψ+⟩ = ( |01⟩+ ⟨10|)/
√
2. ρAB has
eigenvalues λ0 = 0, λ1 = x/3, λ2 = (1 − x)/3 and λ3 =
2/3. The reduced density matrix ρA has eigenvalues δ0 =
(1 + x)/3 and δ1 = (2 − x)/3. Therefore, C(ρAB,HAB) =
2
3 (ǫA + ǫB) + 1−2x
3 (ǫA − ǫB) and C(ρA,HA) = 2 1−2x
3 ǫA.
Adopting Eq.(3) for ρ′
AB, we obtain
ρ′
AB =




1−x
4−2x 0 0 0
0 1
2+2x 0 0
0 0 1
4−2x 0
0 0 0 x
2+2x



 .
Therefore, C(ρ′
AB ,HAB) = 1−x
2+2x (ǫA+ǫB)+ x
4−2x (ǫA−ǫB)
and C(ρ′
A,HA) = 2 1−2x
(2−x)(1+x) ǫA.Thus, f = C(ρ′
A,HA)−
C(ρA,HA) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0,1
2 ), namely, the battery
capacity of the subsystem A will be always enhanced,
see Fig. 2.
If we adopt Eq.(4) for ρ′
AB, similarly we obtain
ρ′
AB =




µ 0(1−x)
2−x 0 0 0

1+x 0 0

1+x

that F = C(ρ′
AB,HAB) − C(ρAB ,HAB) is greater than
0, namely, the battery capacity of the entire system also
increases. On the other hand, as long as xtends to 0 and
µ1 tends to 1, we have C(ρ′
A,HA) − C(ρA,HA) >0, i.e.,
the battery capacity of the subsystem A increases too.
CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
We have studied the enhancement of the quantum bat-
tery capacities for bipartite systems under local projec-
tive measurements. In particular, we have investigated
the cases that the initial states are two-qubit Bell diag-
onal and X-type ones. We have provided analytical re-
5
sults for these general initial states, which indicated that
our scheme can improve the battery capacity of the en-
tire or the subsystems, regardless of whether the original
quantum state is entangled or separable. There are also
other studies on quantum batteries by using quantum
measurements [7, 9, 41, 43, 49], but with diﬀerent ex-
traction protocols. Our study has some advantages com-
pared with, for example, the one in the latest Ref.[41].
Firstly, we adopted the latest deﬁnition of quantum bat-
tery capacity, and our protocol starts directly from the
bipartite quantum states, without considering the auxil-
iary systems. Secondly, Ref.[41] requires multiple mea-
surements and the assistance of POVM measurements.
Here, our protocol only involves one projective measure-
ment. Moreover, we have provided the analytical results
when the initial state is a general 2-qubit quantum state.
The quantum battery capacity is unitary invariant and
solely given by the eigenvalues of the quantum states
and the Hamiltonian. There are relationships between
the battery capacity and the quantum resources such as
quantum entropy, entanglement and coherence [36, 42].
We have shown that the improvement of quantum bat-
tery capacity is related to both the initial states and the
combination forms of the ﬁnal states. Our results indi-
cate that the local projection measurement is a kind of
important resource for improving the capacity of quan-
tum batteries. It would also interesting to investigate the
impact of general positive operator-valued measures on
the improvement of quantum battery capacities.

I. INTRODUCTION
A quantum battery is a device designed to harness
quantum properties to improve the efficiency of energy
storage and retrieval. Traditional batteries store en-
ergy in chemical reactions [1–5], while quantum batter-
ies would utilize the principles of quantum mechanics to
store and release energy in a more efficient and poten-
tially higher-capacity manner [6–13]. The basic idea be-
hind a quantum battery is that quantum systems can ex-
ist in superposition states, meaning they can be in a com-
bination of multiple states simultaneously. This property
could potentially allow quantum batteries to store energy
in a more distributed and efficient way compared to tra-
ditional batteries. Additionally, quantum entanglement,
where particles become correlated in such a way that the
state of one particle determines the state of the other par-
ticle, might enable quantum batteries to further enhance
their energy storage capacity.
Quantum batteries have attracted significant attention
in recent years [6–21]. The primary goal of these ef-
forts is to demonstrate how quantum mechanical systems
and operations can enhance the stored energy or charg-
ing power of a battery. A variety of approaches—ranging
from single-qubit protocols to many-body systems—have
been explored to showcase this quantum advantage [8,
10, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23]. Notable models include the Dicke
quantum battery, which achieves modest speedups due
to collective effects [16, 17], and qubit-based schemes

that demonstrate an N-fold power advantage, point-
ing to strong scalability [8]. Moreover, coherent quan-
tum charging protocols have shown superior performance
compared to classical strategies, with significantly en-
hanced power and robustness against decoherence and
loss [24]. Recent studies have also underscored the im-
portance of interaction topology: optimal performance
in fermionic systems is observed when the interaction
connectivity aligns with the interaction order [23]. In
addition, alternative charging mechanisms such as those
based on the Jaynes–Cummings model reveal that non-
Gaussian cavity states can minimize energy fluctuations
and achieve near-perfect charging fidelity [25]. These the-
oretical developments have been paralleled by experimen-
tal advances, with successful realizations using supercon-
ducting circuits and trapped ions [26–29]. Periodic mod-
ulation techniques have also been applied to spin systems
for efficient charging [30], and the role of dissipation in
open quantum systems has been investigated as a tool
for enhancing performance [12, 31–38]. Notably, global
charging methods—where all cells are charged simultane-
ously—have been shown to offer the strongest quantum
advantage, with power scaling quadratically with the sys-
tem size [21].
There has been a lack of discussion on the combined ef-
fect of the battery and charger in the charging dynamics,
particularly in the context of spin systems. Addressing
this gap, our study explores the interplay between the
battery and charger during the charging process, empha-
sizing their joint influence on energy storage and power
output. Our objective is to understand how optimizing
their interactions can enhance overall performance while
overcoming inherent limitations in the battery’s contri-
bution.
In quantum spin systems, both the battery and the
2
charger play a role in charging dynamics for storing en-
ergy and power. However, we observe that the battery’s
ability to achieve maximum storage energy and power is
often constrained by the charger, which diminishes the
battery’s effect during the charging process. To address
this, we propose introducing an additional term in the
charger Hamiltonian to counteract this limitation. By in-
corporating the battery’s countereffect into the charger,
we enhance both storage energy and power across all con-
sidered configurations. This approach shifts the primary
responsibility for energy storage to the charger, allowing
the battery to adopt a more passive role, thereby optimiz-
ing the charging process and maximizing the efficiency of
quantum batteries.
The manuscript is organized as follows: Section II in-
troduces the setup involving the combined battery and
charger system and defines the key physical quantities
used in the analysis. Section III presents the results of
energy storage and power calculations. Specifically, Sub-
section III A examines the scenario where the battery is
non-interacting and the charger is interacting, while Sub-
section III B addresses the case of an interacting battery
coupled to a non-interacting charger. Subsection III C
explores the dynamics when both the battery and the
charger are interacting. Finally, Section IV summarizes
the main findings and concludes the manuscript.
II. SET-UP
A quantum battery typically comprises a finite num-
ber of quantum systems, such as spins, that can store and
transfer energy at the quantum level. The charger, also a
quantum system composed of spins, is designed to inject
energy into the battery. The dynamics of these spin-
based systems are described by their respective Hamil-
tonians. The battery Hamiltonian, ˆHB, describes the
internal energy levels and/or interactions within the bat-
tery, whereas the charger Hamiltonian, ˆHe
C, encapsulates
the dynamics and properties of the charger.
To initiate the charging process, the charger is con-
nected to the battery, allowing them to interact. This
interaction results in the formulation of the total charg-
ing Hamiltonian, which combines the contributions from
both the battery and the charger. It is expressed as the
sum of the battery Hamiltonian, ˆHB, and the charger
Hamiltonian, ˆHe
C, capturing the dynamics of energy ex-
change between the two systems. Mathematically, it is
expressed as
ˆH = ˆHB + ˆHe
C. (1)
To extend the formulation, we treat the charger Hamil-
tonian in a unique way by considering both interacting
and non-interacting forms. In each case, we incorporate
the countereffect of the battery into the charger Hamil-
tonian to account for the mutual influence between the
battery and charger during the charging dynamics. The

strength of this countereffect is controlled by a parame-
ter, λ, referred to as the battery’s countereffect param-
eter. This modified Hamiltonian is termed the effective
charger Hamiltonian, as it accounts for both the intrinsic
dynamics of the charger and the influence of the battery.
Mathematically, it is given as:
ˆHe
C = ˆHC − λ ˆHB. (2)
This effective charger Hamiltonian is introduced during
the charging process, where it operates alongside the bat-
tery Hamiltonian. By incorporating the battery’s coun-
tereffect into the charger dynamics, the total Hamilto-
nian governing the charging process is updated. Substi-
tuting the effective charger Hamiltonian into the total
Hamiltonian [Eq. 1], we obtain:
ˆH = ˆHB + ˆHC − λ ˆHB = ˆHC + (1 − λ) ˆHB, (3)
Physically interesting range of λ lies between [0 , 1].
When λ = 0, the battery fully contributes to energy stor-
age and power during the charging process. Conversely,
when λ = 1, the battery’s influence is completely nulli-
fied during charging. For intermediate values of λ, the
battery’s effect is progressively reduced, with the extent
of this reduction determined by the strength of λ.
To analyze the counter effect of the battery during the
charging process, we calculate two key metrics: storage
energy and power. The energy stored in the battery dur-
ing the charging process is defined as:
∆E = Tr[ˆρ(t) ˆHB] − Tr[ˆρ(0) ˆHB], (4)
where ˆρ(0) = |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|, and |ψ0⟩ is the ground state of the
battery Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the system’s
state is given as: |ψ(t)⟩ = ˆU(t) |ψ0⟩, where ˆU(t) = e−i ˆHt
is the time-evolution operator.
The storage power quantifies the rate at which energy
is transferred into the system during the charging process
and is given by:
P = ∆E
T . (5)
Here, P represents the average power over the entire
charging duration, and T denotes the total charging time.
3
This formulation provides a measure of how efficiently en-
ergy is accumulated, offering insight into the performance
and effectiveness of the energy storage process.
III. RESULT
To evaluate the performance of the quantum battery,
we compute the stored energy and charging power across
three distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, the battery
is modeled as a non-interacting spin system, while the
charger consists of interacting spins. In the second, the
battery is an interacting spin system, and the charger is
non-interacting. The third configuration involves both
the battery and the charger as interacting spin systems.
These setups allow us to systematically explore how the
battery’s intrinsic properties influence the energy stor-
age and power delivery during the charging process. We
begin our analysis with the first scenario.
A. Non-interacting battery and interacting charger
Hamiltonian
The non-interacting battery is modeled as a collection
of spins aligned along the z-direction, with each spin hav-
ing a strength h. The battery Hamiltonian is defined as:
ˆHB = h
NX
j=1
ˆσz
j , (6)
where N is the total number of spins. In its spectral
decomposition, the battery Hamiltonian can be expressed
as:
ˆHB = h
2N
X
n=1
En|En⟩⟨En|, (7)
where En are the eigenvalues, ranging from −N (ground
state energy) to N (highest energy level). The total num-
ber of energy levels is 2 N , with the ground state and the
highest energy state being non-degenerate. The remain-
ing energy levels exhibit degeneracy, given byN Cl, where
l = 1, 2, . . . , N−1, corresponding to intermediate energy
levels.
The goal of charging the battery is to transition it from
the ground energy state |E1⟩ with energy −Nh to the
highest energy state |E2N ⟩ with energy Nh. The maxi-
mum storage energy ∆Emax is defined as:

strength fixed at λ = 1. In all cases, the parameters used are
J = h = 1, and γ = 0.5.
To examine the influence of the battery’s countereffect
on its storage energy and power, we consider an all-to-
all (ATA) interacting Ising spin system as an interacting
charger, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The interaction strength

where K represents the maximum interaction range. We
4
assume periodic boundary conditions, i.e., ˆ σN+k = ˆσk,
to preserve translational symmetry and eliminate edge
effects. To avoid redundancy under periodic boundary
conditions, we fix K = N−1

2 for
even N, ensuring that each spin pair is included only
once.
We calculate the storage energy of the non-interacting
battery Hamiltonian with the ATA connected Ising spin
system as the charger Hamiltonian for different values
of λ ranging from [0 , 1]. It is observed that for all val-
ues of λ (except at λ = 1), the storage energy increases
and eventually oscillates about a particular value with
random amplitudes and frequencies. At λ = 1, the stor-
age energy increases and saturates at a particular value.
However, at a certain time, a sudden jump occurs, lead-
ing to the highest storage energy, ∆ Emax = 2hN. This
suggests that at this value of λ, the battery reaches its
highest energy state [Fig. 2(a)].
The storage power exhibits a similar behavior for all
values of λ, increases, reaches its maximum value at a
specific time, and then starts to decrease. As the value
of λ increases, the maximum storage power also increases.
[Fig. 2(b)].
The storage energy is analyzed as a function of the sys-
tem size, with the parameter λ fixed at 1, revealing an
odd-even effect in its behaviour. For odd system sizes,
the storage energy increases, saturates at a particular
value with very small oscillation amplitudes, and then
decreases to zero at a specific time. The region of satu-
ration also depends on the system size. As the system size
increases, the time regime of constant energy increases.
In other words, the storage energy exhibits periodic be-
havior, with the period of the storage energy increasing
as the system size grows [Fig. 2(c1)]. Additioanlay, max-
ima of the storage energy also increase with increasing
system size. Conversely, for even system sizes, the stor-
age energy increases as time progresses, saturates for a
fixed period, and reaches its maximum value at a specific
time. The maximum value of the storage energy suggests
that, in this scenario, the battery attains its highest en-
ergy state, 2hN. Similar to odd system sizes, the storage
energy for even system sizes also exhibits periodic behav-
ior, with the period increasing as the system size grows [
Fig. 2(c2)].
The storage power of the battery is analyzed as a func-
tion of the system size with a fixed value of λ = 1. It
is observed that while the storage power depends on the
system size, it does not exhibit the odd-even effect. For
all system sizes, the storage power increases over time,
reaches a maximum value, and then begins to decline.
The maximum storage energy increases with the growth
of the system size. [Fig. 2(d)].
Optimum storage energy and power
To better understand how the counter effect influences
the charging process, we investigate how the maximum
storage energy and charging power vary with the counter
effect parameter λ. We also examine how these quantities
scale with the system size. For this purpose, we consider
two distinct types of charger Hamiltonians.
The first type is defined in Eq. (9) and corresponds to
the Ising spin system with ATA interactions. As a special
case, we also study the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising spin
system by setting the interaction range K = 1. In this
case, the charger Hamiltonian simplifies to the standard
NN Ising model:
ˆHC = J
NX
j=1
ˆσx
j ˆσx
j+1. (10)
The second type of charger is qualitatively different and
is based on the XY spin system with ATA interactions.
The Hamiltonian is given by:
ˆHC = (1 + γ)
NX
j=1
 KX
k=1
1
2k−1 ˆσx
j ˆσx
j+k
!
+(1 − γ)
NX
j=1
 KX
k=1

2k−1 ˆσy
j ˆσy
j+k
!
, (11)
where γ is the anisotropy parameter and K denotes the
interaction range. We also consider the NN case of the
Eq. (11)that is obtained by setting K = 1, resulting in
the following Hamiltonian:
ˆHC = (1 + γ)
NX
j=1
ˆσx
j ˆσx
j+1 + (1 − γ)
NX
j=1
ˆσy
j ˆσy
j+1. (12)
By analyzing these different charger configurations, we
systematically compare their influence on the battery’s
maximum storage energy and power. This comparison
provides valuable insights into how the type and range of
interactions affect the performance and optimization of
quantum batteries.
By employing two types of charger Hamiltoni-
ans—Ising and XY models—with both ATA interactions
and their special case of NN interactions, we investigate
the maximum storage energy and power of the battery
as functions of the countereffect strength and the system
size.
In all considered cases, the maximum storage energy
increases with increasing λ and reaches its optimum at
λ = 1. [Fig. 3(a)]. For the Ising spin system with ATA in-
teractions, the maximum storage energy reaches the up-
per bound of 2 hN at λ = 1. In contrast, when restricted
to NN interactions, the storage energy only reaches half
this value, i.e., hN, at the same λ. In the case of the
XY ATA interacting charger, the battery attains a maxi-
mum storage energy greater than hN, though not reach-
ing 2hN. For the XY NN case, the energy remains below
hN even at λ = 1. These observations highlight that
long-range interactions (especially ATA) significantly en-
hance the energy storage capacity of the quantum bat-
tery. Thus, λ = 1 marks an optimal point where energy
5
transfer during the charging protocol becomes most ef-
ficient, particularly in systems with long-range interac-
tions.
The behavior of the storage power also supports the
efficiency of the charging protocol with increasing coun-
tereffect. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the maximum stor-
age power increases approximately linearly with λ in
all the considered cases, reaching its optimum value at
λ = 1. These results reinforce the conclusion that the
countereffect of the battery—modeled by the parameter
λ—facilitates more efficient energy transfer and charg-
ing dynamics. In particular, λ = 1 consistently yields
the best performance in terms of both storage energy
and power across all interacting charger configurations.
Among the different interaction types, the Ising spin sys-
tems (both NN and ATA) exhibit higher storage power
compared to their XY counterparts. This indicates that
the nature of the spin-spin interaction affects the storage
capacity.
Furthermore, we investigate how the system size N in-
fluences the maximum storage energy and power, keeping
the countereffect parameter fixed at λ = 1. Interestingly,
for chargers with ATA interactions, we observe an odd-
even effect in the storage energy behavior. In the Ising
ATA case, when the system size N is even, the max-
imum storage energy reaches its upper bound of 2 hN,
whereas for odd N, it only attains half of that value,
i.e., hN. On the other hand, in the NN Ising interaction
case, the storage energy consistently reaches half of the
maximum possible value, hN, regardless of system size.
A similar odd-even behavior appears in the XY ATA in-
teracting charger. For odd system sizes, the storage en-
ergy remains below half of the maximum value ( < hN),
while for even system sizes, it exceeds half the maximum
(> hN). In contrast, the XY NN configuration yields
a storage energy that remains below hN for all system
sizes [Fig. 3(c)].
The storage power exhibits a linear increase with sys-
tem size N across all the considered charger configura-
tions. Among them, the Ising ATA interaction yields the
highest storage power, demonstrating superior charging
efficiency. In contrast, the XY ATA configuration results
in the lowest storage power, indicating relatively less ef-
ficient energy transfer dynamics [Fig. 3(d)].
B. Interacting battery and non-interacting charger
Hamiltonian
To generalize our observation that the countereffect of
a battery in the charging dynamics enhances storage en-
ergy and power, we now consider a reversed setup: an
interacting battery coupled to a non-interacting charger.
The interacting battery Hamiltonians considered are of
two types: Ising spin system with NN interaction de-
fined by Eq.(10), i.e., ˆHB = J PN
j=1 σx
j σx
j+1, and XY
spin system with NN interaction defined by Eq.(12), i.e.,
ˆHB = (1 + γ) PN
j=1 σx

j+1 + (1 − γ) PN
j=1 σy

non-interacting charger Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (6),
i.e., ˆHC = h PN
j=1 ˆσz
j .
We analyze the storage energy and power of the bat-
tery in two scenarios: one where the battery’s influence
on the charger is present (λ = 0) and another where it is
absent (λ = 1). The results demonstrate that, for both
Ising and XY interacting batteries, storage energy and
power are notably higher when λ = 1, underscoring the
beneficial role of the battery’s countereffect in the charg-
ing dynamics. Additionally, the Ising model consistently
yields superior performance over the XY model in both
metrics, as shown in Fig. 4(a–d).
C. Interacting battery and interacting charger
Hamiltonian
We consider the scenario where both the battery and
charger are governed by interacting Hamiltonians. First,
we analyze the case where the battery is modeled by an
Ising spin system with NN interactions [Eq. (10)], and
the charger is described by an NN XY-interacting Hamil-
tonian [Eq. (12)]. We calculate the storage energy and
power in two situations: when the battery’s influence is
present in the charging dynamics ( λ = 0) and when it is
absent (λ = 1). Our results indicate that the presence
of the counter effect of battery during charging leads to
an advantage in both the stored energy and the power
[Fig. 5(a,b)].
Next, we examine the reverse configuration: the bat-
tery is now represented by an NN XY-interacting spin
system [Eq. (12)], while the charger is governed by an
NN Ising-type interaction [Eq. (10)]. In this case, we
again compute the storage energy and power, and we

acting XY spin system as the charger Hamiltonian. (c) ∆ E

battery and NN interacting Ising spin system as the charger
Hamiltonian. The system parameters are N = 12, J = 1, and
γ = 0.5. Periodic boundary conditions are considered.
find that when the battery’s influence is absent in the
charging dynamics (λ = 1), the system exhibits improved
performance in terms of both energy storage and power
[Fig. 5(c,d)].
In nutshell, across all scenarios considered, the pres-
ence of the battery’s counter effect in the charging dy-
namics consistently provides an advantage in both en-
ergy storage and power. This advantage is consistent for
being independent of the interaction and noniteration of
the battery and charger Hamiltonians.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this work, we explored the role of the battery’s coun-
tereffect in the charging dynamics of quantum batteries
composed of spin systems. By analyzing various config-
urations involving both non-interacting and interacting
Hamiltonians for the battery and charger, we demon-
strated how their interplay significantly impacts storage
energy and power.
We began by examining a non-interacting battery cou-
pled to an interacting charger modeled by an ATA Ising
spin system. Our results revealed that incorporating the
battery’s countereffect into the dynamics ( λ = 1) leads
to optimal performance, with the storage energy reaching
its theoretical maximum 2 Nh and the power also peak-
ing. Notably, an odd-even parity effect emerged in energy
storage for increasing system sizes, while power remained
parity-independent.
To further understand the influence of interaction
types and ranges, we compared Ising and XY charger
models with both ATA and NN interactions. Across all
these cases, the optimum storage energy and power con-
sistently occurred at λ = 1, emphasizing the constructive
role of the countereffect in enhancing energy transfer.
Both quantities exhibited linear scaling with system size,
confirming the scalability of our protocol.
Extending the analysis to interacting batteries with
non-interacting chargers, where the battery is governed
by either Ising or XY NN interactions, we observed that
the inclusion of the countereffect continued to offer su-
perior energy and power outcomes. This advantage per-
sisted even in the most general scenario where both the
battery and charger are interacting systems, reinforcing
the robustness of our findings across diverse interaction
frameworks.
Interestingly, in cases where the charger is modeled
with ATA interactions, the charging power peaks be-
yond the physically meaningful range ( λ >1). Although
this shift lies outside the regime of practical relevance, it
suggests the presence of underlying physical mechanisms
that merit deeper investigation. A detailed discussion of
this anomaly is provided in Appendix A.
Altogether, our study establishes the critical impor-
tance of retaining the battery’s countereffect in the
charger Hamiltonian for optimizing quantum battery per-
formance. These insights offer valuable guidance for the
design of efficient and scalable quantum energy storage
devices and open new avenues for exploring interaction-
driven enhancements in quantum thermodynamic proto-
cols.

Appendix A: Charging dynamics beyond physical
regime
In the main manuscript, we investigate the charging
dynamics of quantum batteries within the physically ac-
ceptable range of the countereffect parameter, λ ∈ [0, 1].
Within this regime, both the storage energy and power
attain their maximum at λ = 1. Interestingly, our analy-
sis further reveals that the storage power reaches an even
higher value beyond this physical regime ( λ >1) in the
case of ATA interacting Ising and XY charger Hamil-
tonians. However, the storage energy still achieves its
maximum at λ = 1. Although the region λ > 1 falls
outside the standard physical constraints, we emphasize
this result to highlight its potential implications and to
encourage future investigations into such unconventional
regimes.
We analyze the storage power for a non-interacting
battery defined by Eq. (6) and ATA-interacting Ising and
XY chargers described by Eq. (9) and Eq. (11), respec-
tively, considering the countereffect parameter of the bat-
tery in the range λ ∈ [0, 5]. In both cases, for all values
of λ, the storage power exhibits a consistent trend: it
initially increases, reaches a maximum value, and subse-
quently decreases after a certain time [Fig. 6(a,b)]. The
maximum storage power, Pmax, depends on λ and in-
creases with it, attaining its peak at λ = 1 .6 for the
ATA interacting Ising charger and λ = 2.8 for the ATA
interacting XY charger. Beyond these points, the stor-
age power decreases with further increases in λ [inset of
Fig. 6(a,b)]. Remarkably, the highest Pmax values occur
outside the physically accepted regime ( λ >1)."

We explore a protocol that efficiently charges multiple open quantum batteries in parallel using
a single charger. This protocol shows super-extensive charging through collective coupling of the
charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir. When applied to multiple quantum batteries,
each coupled to different thermal reservoirs, the energy cannot be efficiently transferred from the
charger to the battery via collective dissipation alone. We show that the counter-intuitive act of
incorporating both dissipation and incoherent collective pumping on the charger enables efficient
parallel charging of many quantum batteries.
Quantum batteries (QB) have attracted significant re-
cent attention for the potential of transferring and stor-
ing energy via quantum mechanically enhanced processes
[1–9]. Such devices could prove useful in the control, ma-
nipulation and powering of quantum technologies. Ini-
tially, QBs were considered in a closed system with uni-
tary dynamics, where it was demonstrated that using en-
tangling unitary operations allows for the extraction of
more work [1]. QBs have since been considered in several
open system frameworks [10, 11]. In particular, the Dicke
model [12], which considers an ensemble of spins collec-
tively coupled to a photon mode, can be employed to
speed up the charging time of a QB [13–18]. The crucial
aspect is that quantum characteristics—such as entan-
glement, quantum coherence, and superradiant (collec-
tive) behaviours—can enable more powerful and efficient
charging processes compared to classical methods [2, 19].
Recently, an open quantum battery protocol was intro-
duced where a charger, initially comprising an ensemble
of spins in the excited state, charges a battery consisting
of a smaller spin ensemble [20]. The charger and battery
are not directly coupled to each other, but are collectively
coupled to a single thermal reservoir. The charging pro-
cess is initiated by switching on the coupling between
the spin ensembles and the reservoir. Collective dissipa-
tion in the entire system leads to spin inversion [21, 22],
thereby charging the battery. Counter-intuitively, the
energy stored in the spins of the battery does not de-
cay to the ground state even in the presence of a zero-
temperature thermal reservoir: the charged state of the
battery remains stable while connected to the charger.
This phenomenon arises because the steady state of the
charger and battery includes a component that does not
interact with the reservoir and thus avoids decaying to
the ground state. Such states are known as dark states,
which emerge when multiple spins are collectively cou-
pled to a bosonic mode [23, 24]. This is due to the collec-
tive coupling of all the spins in the battery and charger to
the thermal reservoir and should not be viewed as energy
transfer due to the emission of a photon by the charger
followed by the absorption of that photon by the battery.
Provided the number of spins in the charger is signif-
icantly larger than the number of the spins in the bat-
tery, all the spins in the battery will transition to the
excited state [20]. As part of our research, we take the
next critical step to simultaneously charge multiple bat-
teries in parallel, each located in separate reservoirs using
a single, centralized charger. Our method for efficiently
charging multiple quantum batteries incorporates exter-
nal resources to continuously pump the charger, thereby
providing a steady supply of energy to the charger-QB
system. This protocol relies on multiple incoherent pro-
cesses including collective dissipation and pumping.
We start by exploring the model of a general charger-
battery system, consisting of two ensembles of identical
spin−1/2 particles with frequency ω0/2π. Both ensem-
bles are collectively coupled to the same bosonic reser-
voir. One ensemble is designated as the charger C, and
the other as the battery B. The Hamiltonian for this
system is:

where the subscript µ denotes the charger C or bat-
tery B. Initially, the energy densities of the system are
EC (0) /(ℏω0) = 1 and EB (0) /(ℏω0) = 0. Efficient trans-
fer means the energy density of the battery will go to
EB (tf) /(ℏω0) ∼ 1 at some time tf.
Nominally, there are two scales for which we can look
at this open quantum battery protocol [20]. Small scale
systems for which the number of spins in the batteries
and the charger are kept small, these can be modeled via
solving the master equation directly. In systems where
the battery and the charger have large spin numbers,
solving the master equation exactly is challenging. Here,
we can employ a mean-field approximation to solve for
the dynamics at large scales.
In general, for this process to transfer energy from the
charger to the QB [ EB(tf) > EC(tf)], it requires the con-
dition NC > NB; that is, the charger must be larger than
the battery. Efficient energy transfer [ EB/(ℏω0) → 1] oc-
curs when NC ≫ NB. Notably, this charging process is
most efficient for zero-temperature reservoirs. However,
as the reservoir temperature increases, energy transfer
can still be achieved, albeit the process is less efficient
[EB(tf)/(ℏω0) < 1]. Importantly, while the spins in the
battery and the charger are not directly coupled, the col-
lective coupling between all spins and the thermal reser-
voir allows for effective long range interactions between
the battery and the charger. Entanglement is generated
between the battery and the charger through this process
[21, 25].
In the following, we explore how to utilize this process
to charge multiple QBs in parallel. While it is known that

ing of many QBs coupled to separate thermal reservoirs. A
central spin ensemble labelled ‘charger’ is coupled to three
separate thermal reservoirs. Each individual reservoir con-
tains a QB (a spin ensemble smaller than the charger). Pic-
tured here is the initial state of the total system, with all spins
in the charger prepared in the excited state and all spins in
all QBs in the ground state. Through the combination of
the collective spin relaxation and the collective pumping on
the charger, the energy density can be transferred from the
charger to the battery.
many QBs can be efficiently charged if they are coupled
to the same reservoir [13], this induces a severe spatial
constraint on the location of the QBs, as they must all
couple to the same field. Ideally, we would want to utilize
a central charger that can be coherently coupled to many
different thermal reservoirs, with each reservoir holding
its own QB. This allows the QBs to be potentially fur-
ther apart and can in principle direct energy towards
other devices. Another advantage of coupling to inde-
pendent reservoirs could be the ability to accommodate
asymmetrical coupling configurations [26].
Extending the model from a single QB in one reservoir
(2) to multiple QBs each in its own separate reservoir,
yields the following master equation:

where the presence of m zero-temperature reservoirs
yields incoherent dissipative processes between the cen-

Fig. 1 for m = 3. The last term in (4) corresponds to
incoherent collective pumping on the charger withγ⇑ rep-
resenting the rate of collective pumping. We use a mean-
field approximation on (4) to model the system. The en-
ergy density dynamics of the charger and the QBs is given
in Fig. 2. First, in Fig. 2(a), we present the large-scale
dynamics of the charger and a single QB from the original
proposal in Ref. [20]. This scheme does not involve collec-
tive pumping (γ⇑ = 0). This dynamics shows the charger

Figure 2. Energy density charging QBs with collective dissipation and pumping. The red curve corresponds to the ‘charger’
with a spin population of NC = 107. The three batteries correspond to the solid dark blue, dashed yellow and dashed green
curves, each with the same spin population of NB1 = NB2 = NB3 = 102. The battery curves of each plot all overlap. In (a),
the charger is coupled to a single reservoir with one QB using collective dissipation and no collective pumping ( γ⇑ = 0). In (b),
the charger is coupled to two reservoirs each holding a QB of NB = 102 spins and no collective pumping is applied to the
charger (γ⇑ = 0). In (c), the system is the same as (b), but an incoherent collective pump of strength γ⇑ = γ⇓ is now applied
to the charger. In (d), the charger is coupled to three reservoirs each holding a QB and no collective pumping is applied to the
charger (γ⇑ = 0). In (e), the system is the same as (d), but an incoherent collective pump of strength γ⇑ = γ⇓ is now applied
to the charger. In (f), the system is the same as (e), with an incoherent collective pump of strength γ⇑ = 2γ⇓. The inset shows
dynamics with collective pumping ( γ⇑ = 2γ⇓) but with EC(0) = 0, indicating that it is both the collective spin relaxation and
collective pumping combined that facilitates the charging of these QBs.
being initialized with EC(0)/(ℏω0) = 1, corresponding to
all spins in the charger being in the excited state. Here,
we can see efficient charging showing EB/(ℏω0) → 1, and
this happens on a superradiant time-scale, demonstrating
the collective speed up due to the presence of many spins.
In Figs. 2 (b, c), the charger is coupled to two reservoirs
each holding a QB of NB = 102 spins. In Figs. 2 (d -
f), the charger is coupled to three reservoirs each hold-
ing a QB. Figs. 2 (b, d) illustrate what happens when
this system is extended to charge more batteries in more
reservoirs without collective pumping. The steady-states
of the two [Fig. 2(b)] and three [Fig. 2(d)] QB systems re-
veal a crucial limitation when this scheme is extended to
multiple thermal reservoir couplings. While only one spe-
cific spin population configuration is shown here, through
numerical exploration, for two reservoirs, we find that
with no collective pumping, the limit of EB/(ℏω0) → 1/2
cannot be surpassed no matter how much larger NC is
than NB. For three reservoirs, this limit is further re-
duced to EB/(ℏω0) → 1/4. It is important to stress that
this effect is due to the presence of additional decay chan-
nels through the coupling to multiple thermal reservoirs.
If the three QBs were all contained in the same reser-
voir with the charger, one could witness efficient charg-
ing. However, the presence of multiple thermal reservoirs
severely diminishes the charging capability of this proto-
col using dissipation alone.
In the case of a single thermal reservoir, collective dissi-
pation is sufficient to achieve high power collective charg-
ing of a QB. However, when this model is extended to
multiple reservoirs with multiple QBs, the presence of
these decay channels mean that many QBs cannot be
efficiently charged in parallel via the same mechanism.
Therefore, one might conclude that charging multiple
QBs through multiple collective dissipation channels is
not a viable strategy. To address this, we will now in-
troduce the main result of this work. Here, we present
an adapted strategy to efficiently charge multiple QBs
in parallel. Our protocol is pictured schematically in
Fig. 1 and depicts a central spin ensemble labeled as the
‘charger’ coupled to three separate thermal reservoirs.
Coupled to each individual reservoir is its own QB. The
initial state of the system before charging the QBs has
the charger initialized in the fully excited state and all
QBs in their ground state. To efficiently charge all three
QBs in parallel, continuous collective pumping must be
applied to the central charger as the system simultane-
ously experiences collective dissipation. Results are given
in Figs. 2 (c, f). Here, we see that through the addition of
a incoherent collective pump on the charger only, we can
achieve efficient energy transfer from charger to battery.
By comparison with Fig. 2(a), our scheme can produce
the same highly efficient energy transfer, from charger to
multiple batteries in separate reservoirs. We empahsize
that this effect cannot be seen if the charger is coherently
pumped. It is the presence of the incoherent collective
pump that facilitates efficient energy transfer.
From Fig. 2, we observe that the presence of the inco-
herent pump slightly slows the superradiant decay when
the number of QBs is fixed. While the pump adds more
energy, the entire system takes longer to relax, thereby
slightly extending the charging time. Nonetheless, the
4
charging process still occurs on the timescales of collec-
tive effects. Lastly, while entanglement can be generated
between spins in different spin ensembles (QBs and the
charger) in the absence of pumping [25], we find that with
collective pumping, there is little to no entanglement be-
tween the QBs and the charger. Despite the absence of
entanglement, we find efficient energy transfer between a
charger and multiple QBs. We note it has recently been
shown [18] that entanglement is not associated with the
collective charging speed up in the Dicke quantum bat-
tery, rather the enhancement is due to coherent cooper-
ative interactions.
The collective pumping strength γ⇑ required for effi-
cient charging depends on the number of thermal reser-
voirs coupled to the charger. In Fig. 2 (d, e, f), we focus
on the three reservoir system (depicted in Fig. 1) and
show the dynamics for pumping strength γ⇑ = γ⇓ in
Fig. 2(e). We observe that γ⇑ = γ⇓ can only half excite
the QBs, and γ⇑ = 2 γ⇓ [Fig. 2(f)] is required to fully
charge the three QBs in the system. In principle, our
strategy could be adapted to charge more QBs from one
single centralized charger. However, we expect that as
more reservoirs are utilized, higher collective pumping
strengths are likely needed for efficient charging in this
system. The ergotropy of this quantum battery proto-
col has already been considered for the single QB system
[20].
Our scheme can be implemented in many different hy-
brid quantum systems [27], including spin ensembles in
the microwave regime coupled to waveguide or microwave
resonators, which act as reservoirs. A possible implemen-
tation could utilize diamond samples with nitrogen va-
cancy defect centers as the spin ensembles [28, 29]. In this
system, coherent coupling of two distinct spin ensembles
has been realized [30]. Additionally, another candidate
for the spin ensembles could be erbium dopants, which
operate in the optical region [31].
Lastly, we remark on a few key aspects of this work.
While the dynamics presented does not include individ-
ual effects such as individual decay, we emphasize that
these effects occur on timescales that are much slower
than collective effects for large ensemble sizes. Further,
one may wonder if superradiant decay of the charger is
necessary for efficient energy transfer in our scheme with
collective pumping. To address this, we refer to the inset
in Fig. 2(f). This inset shows the energy density dy-
namics following (4) with EC(0) = 0. On comparable
timescales, no transfer of energy is observed and therefore
we stress that it is the combination of both the spin relax-
ation and collective pumping that enables this charging
process.
In conclusion, we have introduced a method that cir-
cumvents limitations induced on charging multiple quan-
tum batteries in separate reservoirs through collective
dissipation alone. By performing incoherent, collective
pumping on the charger, we can fully charge many QBs
while they are indirectly coupled to the charger through
independent reservoirs. This protocol permits the QBs
to be somewhat spatially separated as they do not all
need to be coupled to the same reservoir. Our method
can be scaled to charge more batteries than shown here,
although a stronger collective pump is likely needed in
such a case. This protocol can also be applied to transfer
energy and quantum correlations between multiple spin
ensembles arranged in series [25, 32, 33]. Our results have
important implications of how the flow of energy can be
manipulated in quantum devices. This paves the way
for advances in quantum thermodynamics and outlines
potential directions for quantum technologies.

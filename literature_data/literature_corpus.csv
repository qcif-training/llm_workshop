Local-projective-measurement-enhanced quantum battery capacity,"Quantum batteries have significant potential applications for future industry and daily life. The capacity is an important indicator for a battery. Methods to improve the capacity of quantum batteries are important. We consider quantum batteries given by bipartite quantum systems and study the enhancement of the battery capacity under local projective measurements on a subsystem of the quantum state. By using two-qubit Bell-diagonal states and X-type states as examples, we show that quantum battery capacity with respect to the whole system or a subsystem can be improved by local projective measurements. Our theoretical analysis will provide ideas for the experimental development of quantum batteries.",2024-05-06,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03093v1,"Tinggui Zhang, Hong Yang, Shao-Ming Fei","Researchers investigated methods to enhance the capacity of quantum batteries, a crucial aspect for their potential applications.

Entanglement and energy transportation in the central-spin quantum battery,"Quantum battery exploits the principle of quantum mechanics to transport and store energy. We study the energy transportation of the central-spin quantum battery, which is composed of $N_b$ spins serving as the battery cells, and surrounded by $N_c$ spins serving as the charger cells. We apply the invariant subspace method to solve the dynamics of the central-spin battery with a large number of spins. We establish a universal inverse relationship between the battery capacity and the battery-charger entanglement, which persists in any size of the battery and charger cells. Moreover, we find that when $N_b=N_c$, the central-spin battery has the optimal energy transportation, corresponding to the minimal battery-charger entanglement. Surprisingly, the central-spin battery has a uniform energy transportation behaviors in certain battery-charger scales. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic relationship between the battery-charger size and the energy transportation efficiency, which may provide more insights on designing other types of quantum batteries.",2025-02-11,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07513v1,"Fan Liu, Hui-Yu Yang, Shuai-Li Wang, Jun-Zhong Wang, Kun Zhang, Xiao-Hui Wang","This study explores the concept of a quantum battery, which utilizes quantum mechanics to transport and store energy.

High-performance Kerr quantum battery,"We propose and investigate the performance of a hybrid quantum battery, the so-called Kerr quantum battery, which consists of two interacting quantum oscillators, i.e., the charger is a harmonic oscillator and the battery is an anharmonic oscillator involving the Kerr nonlinearity. Such a setup creates nonuniform spacing between energy levels of the quantum oscillator that increases with the energy level. We find that the Kerr quantum battery can store more energy than the qubit battery and reaches maximum stored energy faster than the harmonic oscillator battery. In particular, the average charging power of the Kerr quantum battery is larger than the qubit battery. Furthermore, most of the stored energy in the Kerr quantum battery can be extracted for work. All of the properties of the Kerr quantum battery are controlled by the strength of nonlinearity, in which the enhancement of the nonlinearity transforms the battery from a harmonic oscillator to a qubit.",2023-05-04,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03202v2,"Muhammad Shoufie Ukhtary, Ahmad R.

However, there are still many unresolved issues in the field of quantum batteries. For example, how to improve battery space utilization, maximize battery energy storage, and how to increase and control the charging power of quantum batteries. A major challenge is how to achieve better charging power without reducing the energy storage of the quantum batteries. Here, we propose a controllable dual-cavity quantum battery which can increase the charging power without diminishing capacity of the quantum batteries by manipulating the number of atoms .

Optimizing quantum battery performance by reducing battery influence in charging dynamics,"Quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices that work within the quantum regime and provide energy storage and power delivery. We investigate the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians, with a particular focus on minimizing the battery s influence during the charging dynamics. To achieve this, we introduce a control parameter that allows us to suppress the battery s contribution during the charging dynamics. We explore various configurations, including a non-interacting many-body battery with an interacting many-body charger, an interacting battery with a non-interacting charger, and systems where both the battery and charger are interacting many-body systems. Our results reveal a notable enhancement in stored energy and charging power when the battery s influence is suppressed, underscoring the pivotal role of the charger in optimizing performance.

NMR investigations of quantum battery using star-topology spin systems,"Theoretical explorations have revealed that quantum batteries can exploit quantum correlation to achieve faster charging, thus promising exciting applications in future technologies. Using NMR architecture, here we experimentally investigate various aspects of quantum battery with the help of nuclear spin systems in star-topology configuration. We first carry out numerical analysis to study how charging a quantum battery depends on the relative purity factors of charger and battery spins. By experimentally measuring the polarization of the battery spin undergoing charging, we estimate the battery energy and establish the theoretically predicted quantum advantage. We propose using the quantum advantage, which depends on the entanglement among chargers and battery, as a measure for estimating the size of the entangled cluster.

Distribution Relationship of Quantum Battery Capacity,"The distribution relationship of quantum battery capacity is investigated. First, it is proved that for two-qubit X-states, the sum of the subsystem battery capacities does not exceed the total system's battery capacity, and the conditions are provided under which they are equal. Then define the difference between the total system's and subsystems'battery capacities as the residual battery capacity (RBC) and show that this can be divided into coherent and incoherent components. Furthermore, it is observed that this capacity monogamy relation for quantum batteries extends to general n-qubit X states and any n-qubit X state's battery capacity distribution can be optimized to achieve capacity gain through an appropriate global unitary evolution. Specifically, for general three-qubit X states, stronger distributive relations are derived for battery capacity. Quantum batteries are believed to hold significant potential for outperforming classical counterparts in the future. These findings contribute to the development and enhancement of quantum battery theory.",2025-02-05,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02860v1,"Yiding Wang, Xiaofen Huang, Tinggui Zhang","This study investigates the distribution of quantum battery capacity, focusing on two-qubit and n-qubit X-states.

Enhancing self-discharging process with disordered quantum batteries,"One of the most important devices emerging from quantum technology are quantum batteries. However, self-discharging, the process of charge wasting of quantum batteries due to decoherence phenomenon, limits their performance, measured by the concept of ergotropy and half-life time of the quantum battery. The effects of local field fluctuation, introduced by disorder term in Hamiltonian of the system, on the performance of the quantum batteries is investigated in this paper. The results reveal that the disorder term could compensate disruptive effects of the decoherence, i.e. self-discharging, and hence improve the performance of the quantum battery via ""incoherent gain of ergotropy"" procedure. Adjusting the strength of disorder parameter to a proper value and choosing a suitable initial state of quantum battery, the amount of free ergotropy, defined with respect to free Hamiltonian, could exceed the amount of initial stored ergotropy. In addition harnessing the degree of disorder parameter could help to enhance the half-life time of the quantum battery. This study opens perspective to further investigation of the performance of quantum batteries that explore disorder and many-body effects.",2021-12-14,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07317v2,"Mohammad B.

Efficient charging of multiple open quantum batteries through dissipation and pumping,"We explore a protocol that efficiently charges multiple open quantum batteries in parallel using a single charger. This protocol shows super-extensive charging through collective coupling of the charger and the battery to the same thermal reservoir. When applied to multiple quantum batteries, each coupled to different thermal reservoirs, the energy cannot be efficiently transferred from the charger to the battery via collective dissipation alone. We show that the counter-intuitive act of incorporating both dissipation and incoherent collective pumping on the charger enables efficient parallel charging of many quantum batteries.",2024-10-25,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19303v1,"Josephine Dias, Hui Wang, Kae Nemoto, Franco Nori, William J.

Dissipative charging of a quantum battery,"We show that a cyclic unitary process can extract work from the thermodynamic equilibrium state of an engineered quantum dissipative process. Systems in the equilibrium states of these processes serve as batteries, storing energy. The dissipative process that brings the battery to the active equilibrium state is driven by an agent that couples the battery to thermal systems.
